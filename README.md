Homework - Week 5: Daily Planner

## Description

The assignment was to create a functional daily work planner using jQuery and reference the online library "Moment" to display the accurate time wherever the user of the application is located.

When the application loads, the user will see a date stamp located in the header that displays the current time. Beneath the header is a table with individual rows for the average 8hr. workday. The user can type out their goals for each hour, and click the 'Save' button to keep their goal in that same hour block if they refresh the app. 

Between the hours of 9am to 5pm, the colors of each row will change depending on whether the hour has past, is currently happening, or will happen in the future. The user will notice that past hours change to gray, with the input text turning a dimmer color, the present hour will have a red shade with bold font, and upcoming hours will be green and have standard weight font.

Once the day is complete, the user can click the "Start New Day" button in the header to clear the table and start the process again for the next day.

The styling inspiration was to create an application for managing the daily stresses of a work day, but give the appearance a calming color scheme to hopefully relax the user.
